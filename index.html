              <h3>Biography</h3>
              <p>Hello! My name is Lucas.</p>
              <p>I am a full stack web developer with over 8 years of experience.</p>
              <p>
                I am proficient in a variety of web technologies, including React, Typescript / Javascript, MySQL, GraphQL, HTML, CSS and more. I prefer to
                focus efforts on results based development, rather than what “feels” right. I love to learn new technologies and believe highly in continuing
                education.
              </p>
              <p>
                I know that there are often many ways to achieve a desired outcome and am always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the users'
                experience. I am passionate about creating websites that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability. I am also committed to
                optimizing for search engines and page load speeds.
              </p>
              <p>
                I work as a Front End Web Developer for<!-- -->
                <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.starkey.com/">Starkey Hearing</a>, the leader in hearing technologies on the planet.
              </p>
              <p>
                In my free time, I enjoy fixing bicycles, but they're much more fun to ride. I also love coffee, hiking, camping, skateboarding, photography,
                live music, bookbinding and reading science fiction.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you have a project you would like to discuss, I would love to hear all about it. I work on a sliding scale for web development, especially
                for non-profit or community based organizations. Please reach out to me at <a href="mailto: lucasmace4130@gmail.com">lucasmace4130@gmail.com</a>

            <h1>Biography</h1>
            <p>Hello! My name is Lucas.</p>
            <p>
              I am a full stack web developer with over <span id="experience" aria-hidden="true">8 years</span>
              <span class="sr-only">8 years</span> of&nbsp;experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              I am proficient in a variety of web technologies, including React, Typescript / Javascript, MySQL, GraphQL, HTML, CSS and more. I prefer to focus
              efforts on results based development, rather than what “feels” right. I love to learn new technologies and believe highly in continuing education.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know that there are often many ways to achieve a desired outcome and am always looking for new and innovative ways to improve the users'
              experience. I am passionate about creating websites that are accessible to everyone, regardless of their ability. I am also committed to
              optimizing for search engines and page load speeds.
            </p>
            <p>
              I work as a Front End Web Developer for <a target="_blank" rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.starkey.com/">Starkey Hearing</a>, the leader in
              hearing technologies on the planet.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my free time, I enjoy fixing bicycles, but they're much more fun to ride. I also love coffee, hiking, camping, skateboarding, photography, live
              music, bookbinding and reading science fiction.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you have a project you would like to discuss, I would love to hear all about it. I work on a sliding scale for web development, especially for
              non-profit or community based organizations. Please reach out to me at
              <a href="mailto: lucasmace4130@gmail.com" data-http>lucasmace4130@gmail.com</a>
